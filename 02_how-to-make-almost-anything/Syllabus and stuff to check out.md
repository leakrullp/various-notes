- [ ] **Read**: [SparkFun Inventor’s Kit manual](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/sparkfun-inventors-kit-experiment-guide---v40/introduction) (a very useful resource with lots of circuits that you can try). It is also [available as a pdf](https://learnit.itu.dk/pluginfile.php/421515/mod_resource/content/0/SparkFun_Inventors_Kit_Guide_V4.0a.pdf). (You do not read it before the lecture).

- [ ] **Watch**: Take a look at the board with different sensors, which is located in the corridor next to the dirty lab (5A54).
- [ ] **Lecture**: See slides below.
- [ ] **Exercises**: Test a stepper motor and a servo motor.
- [ ] **MA**: There is no MA, but stepper and servo motors are very common in student projects and typical questions in the exam. I strongly recommend that you test and understand both types of motors.
